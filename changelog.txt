1.2.0
- **Added dialogue! 1,231 lines total so far** - including combat barks, pre-fight banter, memories, and intro sequences between vanilla characters and the ones from this mod.
	- no memories for ilya yet; can't fit them all into that screen yet lol.  haven't had time to draw custom bgs yet either.
	- no dialogue w/ other modded characters yet, either.  i'll get around to that eventually, I hope.
- **A lot of balance changes** (mostly nerfs), QOL changes, and fixes.
- Dialogue sprites adjusted, not that you were seeing those often beforehand!

notices for players:
- this build requires the beta branch to function (1.0.6 at time of writing) due to vanilla code changes: this is what most mods are developed on.
- for those of you who use the dev menu: using "unlock all" also marks all dialogues as seen.  if you don't want to miss the one-off scenes from this mod and from others, take caution when using it (don't, or use it prior to loading your game with mods to unlock vanilla content only.)

for other character modders: while I don't recommend most of this mod's boilerplate (structured to load in a metric ton of content, past the scope of most character mods), i would recommend taking a peek at the json externalization, derived from the base game's code ofc.  might be an option you find more attractive than baking it into the code, even if you don't plan on localization

CARDS
- All Hands' cost increased to 4.  All Hands B is now a cost reduction to 3, instead of changing its functionality.

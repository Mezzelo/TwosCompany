2.0.0
NEW STUFF (and removed stuff)
+ Two new characters - Jost and Gauss, with 45 cards and 11 artifacts (1 starter) between them.  Both utilize new, novel mechanics that deviate further from vanilla than the original trio.
+ 963 new lines of dialogue (2,194 total), including previously missing dialogue from vanilla events.
+ 6 new memories.  Still missing a character, but the last one isn't directly related to the story.
+ Added support for alternate starting decks from TheJazMaster's more difficulties mod.

+ Added a new card to Isabelle's deck, Goad, and removed Backdraft and Outmaneuver to bring existing characters in line with vanilla distribution.
	~ (removed cards still exist, to preserve save compatibility - just aren't offered or shown in codex)
~ Re-added Incendiary Rounds, which was accidentally removed.  Whoops!  Also reworked it completely, see below.

1.2.0
- **Added dialogue! 1,231 lines total so far** - including combat barks, pre-fight banter, memories, and intro sequences between vanilla characters and the ones from this mod.
	- no memories for ilya yet; can't fit them all into that screen yet lol.  haven't had time to draw custom bgs yet either.
	- no dialogue w/ other modded characters yet, either.  i'll get around to that eventually, I hope.
- **A lot of balance changes** (mostly nerfs), QOL changes, and fixes.
- Dialogue sprites adjusted, not that you were seeing those often beforehand!

notices for players:
- this build requires the beta branch to function (1.0.6 at time of writing) due to vanilla code changes: this is what most mods are developed on.
- for those of you who use the dev menu: using "unlock all" also marks all dialogues as seen.  if you don't want to miss the one-off scenes from this mod and from others, take caution when using it (don't, or use it prior to loading your game with mods to unlock vanilla content only.)

for other character modders: while I don't recommend most of this mod's boilerplate (structured to load in a metric ton of content, past the scope of most character mods), i would recommend taking a peek at the json externalization, derived from the base game's code ofc.  might be an option you find more attractive than baking it into the code, even if you don't plan on localization

CARDS
- All Hands' cost increased to 4.  All Hands B is now a cost reduction to 3, instead of changing its functionality.
+ Call and Response now discounts the drawn card's cost by 1 across all variants.  A decreases cost by 2.
	~ Reworded description to hopefully make this more concise.
	- (fix) You can no longer C&R a C&R, as this would lead to a crash (and also make for a silly infinite) - thanks to Arin for finding this.
~ Captain's Orders now gives you the played card's base cost, rather than its current cost.
+ (fix) Let Loose no longer increases the cost of 0-cost cards - thanks to Arin for finding this.
- Onslaught is now limited based on stacks: Base and A give 3 stacks, and drawing a card uses a stack.  B gives 6 stacks.
	- (fix) Onslaught will no longer reshuffle your discard into your draw if there are no cards it can draw from your discard

- Removed the first attack from Wild Strikes (1-1-1 to 1-1) and the dodges were changed to move 2-1, across all variants.

- Apex's self-inflicted engine lock increased by 1 for all variants. (3 base, 2 for A, 4 for B.)

~ Metronome now displays whether you've last attacked or moved - thanks to Shockah for the suggestion.
	- It now requires 6 consecutive alternating moves/attacks, increased from 5.
	+ Multiple consecutive attacks from the same card will no longer reset the counter, to make it usable on i.e. ships with multiple cannons.
+ Incendiary Rounds now adds an additional heat on shot, and causes enemies to overheat immediately from heat added by this artifact.
	~ (fixed typo.  how'd nobody point this out dammit)
~ (fix) Shield Shunt should no longer crash your game - thanks to LazyFangs for diagnosing this.
- Worn Lighter now gives 1 overdrive, instead of 2.

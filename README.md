# Two's Company 2.5.1 - for game version 1.1

A mod for Cobalt Core, featuring My bingus blorbos.

Requires EWanderer's modloader or Shockah's Nickel modloader to run. Nickel is highly recommended, as it comes with many QOL features and allows you to scroll memories.

Please not that this is a *legacy mod* - if using Nickel, you will need to unzip this mod into your mod folder.
